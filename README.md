I'm a machine learning engineer / data scientist / travel nerd.
I'm into geospatial data science, end-to-end ML automation and deployment, and data engineering.
I also sometimes hunt for Sasquatch 👣 &nbsp; and watch for UFOs 🛸.

## Datasets
I maintain several pretty popular datasets on [data.world](https://data.world/timothyrenner).
You might notice a theme.


* 👣 &nbsp; [Bigfoot Sightings](https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data) ([repo](https://github.com/timothyrenner/bfro_sightings_data), [Dash App](https://bigfoot-sightings-dash.herokuapp.com/))
* 🛸 &nbsp; [UFO Sightings](https://data.world/timothyrenner/ufo-sightings) ([repo](https://github.com/timothyrenner/nuforc_sightings_data))
* 👻 &nbsp; [Haunted Places](https://data.world/timothyrenner/haunted-places) ([repo](https://github.com/timothyrenner/shadowlands-haunted-places))
* 🐺 &nbsp; [Dogman Sightings](https://data.world/timothyrenner/dogman-sightings) ([repo](https://github.com/timothyrenner/nadp-sightings-data))

All of these were collected from publicly accessible data, either via file downloads or web scrapers of highly questionable code quality.
